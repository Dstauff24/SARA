    "response": "Totally understand where you\u2019re coming from \u2014 on the surface, listing can seem like the better option. But when you factor in time, agent fees, inspections, repairs, and buyer negotiations, the net usually isn\u2019t as high as expected. Our offer is built around netting you something clean and guaranteed \u2014 with no uncertainty.",

    "response": "Great question \u2014 I get why that might be confusing. What we do is partner with local investors who are actively looking for homes like yours. That lets us bring you a competitive offer, and our team manages the process from A to Z so you\u2019re not stuck doing the legwork.",

What we do though is look at the full picture \u2014 things like the roof, HVAC, or kitchen layout that investors typically renovate regardless.

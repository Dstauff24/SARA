    "response": "Great question \u2014 it\u2019s simpler than most people expect. We walk you through a quick assessment of your home, present an offer based on local comps and condition, and if you accept, we handle everything from paperwork to closing.",

    "response": "That\u2019s totally fair to ask. The way we work is by partnering with vetted buyers we trust, which allows us to tailor the offer to fit your timeline and condition. It keeps things simple and gives you more flexibility.",

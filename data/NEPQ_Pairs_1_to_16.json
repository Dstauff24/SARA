To clarify, I work closely with a few vetted local partners, and our goal is to make this process as smooth and certain for you as possible. The reason we operate this way is to ensure we match your property with the right type of buyer, based on what the home needs and your ideal timeline. But the best part is: you\u2019re not dealing with dozens of people or showings. Just me \u2014 all the way through.",

Just to explain where that number\u2019s coming from: when we looked at similar homes that sold nearby, and factored in what this one might need in repairs or updates, that number is where a typical buyer would need to be to make the math work. That said \u2014 I\u2019m on your team here. Let me ask, what number were you hoping for?",
